        <p>Hi [Patient Name], this is [Your Name] calling from Bravella Health.   
            Is this a good time to chat?  I was hoping to schedule a first visit with a member of our team. </p>
        <p>[If no ask]: Is there a good time to call you back in the next day or two? Or would you prefer to coordinate by email? </p>
            <p>[If yes, proceed] 
                Thank you for expressing interest in Bravella Health and for requesting a first appointment by filling out the contact e form. 
                The first step in enrolling in the program is to hear more about it from our concierge.   This is a complimentary video visit where they will review the program, discuss your needs or goals, answer any of your questions and, if you choose, get you enrolled and scheduled to meet with the healthcare team. 
                I have a few times available for you to consider - do you have your calendar at hand? </p>
        <p>[If no]: thatâ€™s alright, would you like me to send you some options by email? Or if you have a few more moments I could run a quick search for more options?
            [If yes, proceed]</p>
            <p>___________
                ___________
                ___________</p>
                <p>
                    If none are possible, ask: is there a day of the week or time of day that works best for you?
